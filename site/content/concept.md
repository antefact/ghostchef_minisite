Most of the ‘intelligent’ assistants that we see today or in many visions of the future are in form of bots that ‘assist’ you or even take over the actions of cooking for you. It almost feels like they all try to be at the centre of the attention. What we were very interested in was to look at those more subtle ways in which intelligence could fit and enhance a chef’s experience, and rather than solving and simplifying it would be aimed at becoming a support and a collaborator, an enhancer of the ability rather than a surrogate.

With this spirit we came out with the Idea Of Ghost chef, an open collaborative platform where you can interact in a "natural way" with an artificial and think together about food: decide what to cook today, think up new recipes, or tweak existing recipes to make them more local, healthy or quicker.

While visual language became very big in the all food universe, we choose to have a text based interaction that is more effective at describing all the nuances of a plate, it's ingredients, and bring up food memories to mind.

Writing with a ghost chef is not like searching for a recipe on google, it's more like having a dialogue with a specific culinary identity, the identity will have its typical style, it's favourite ingredients, and a specific set of values that make its way of cooking interesting.
