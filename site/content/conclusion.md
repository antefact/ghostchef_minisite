_"most of the energy in the deep learning scene is focused on what I’d call “generic” problems… These challenges all depend on standard datasets. And these datasets are extremely boring"_ (Robin Sloan)

As we thrive for creating more transparency for the food we eat also the technology and the tools we create should be transparent. Why is this the best recipe for me or based on what logic this is the thing I should cook or eat? When thinking about creating new intelligent helpers we should make them more transparent, controllable and educational.

We are prototyping ghost chef to understand its limits and full potential, if you are a cook, an AI expert, a food semantic expert or just want to know more about this drop us a line.
