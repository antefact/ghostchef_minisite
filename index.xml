      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô assistants that we see today or in many visions of the future are in form of bots that ‚Äòassist‚Äô you or even take over the actions of cooking for you. It almost feels like they all try to be at the centre of the attention. What we were very interested in was to look at those more subtle ways in which intelligence could fit and enhance a chef‚Äôs experience, and rather than solving and simplifying it would be aimed at becoming a support and a collaborator, an enhancer of the ability rather than a surrogate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this spirit we came out with the Idea Of Ghost chef, an open collaborative platform where you can interact in a &amp;ldquo;natural way&amp;rdquo; with an artificial and think together about food: decide what to cook today, think up new recipes, or tweak existing recipes to make them more local, healthy or quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While visual language became very big in the all food universe, we choose to have a text based interaction that is more effective at describing all the nuances of a plate, it&amp;rsquo;s ingredients, and bring up food memories to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing with a ghost chef is not like searching for a recipe on google, it&amp;rsquo;s more like having a dialogue with a specific culinary identity, the identity will have its typical style, it&amp;rsquo;s favourite ingredients, and a specific set of values that make its way of cooking interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;most of the energy in the deep learning scene is focused on what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù problems‚Ä¶ These challenges all depend on standard datasets. And these datasets are extremely boring&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (Robin Sloan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we thrive for creating more transparency for the food we eat also the technology and the tools we create should be transparent. Why is this the best recipe for me or based on what logic this is the thing I should cook or eat? When thinking about creating new intelligent helpers we should make them more transparent, controllable and educational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are prototyping ghost chef to understand it&amp;rsquo;s limits and full potential, if you are a cook, an AI expert, a food semantic expert or just want to know more about this drop us a line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you bring machine intelligence in an actual kitchen? What role will it have? What role should it have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first image we have in our head when we talk about technology and artificial intelligence is probably a restaurant full of  robot arms chopping food or some sort of recipe generators or a bot, we believe that there are a lot more interesting scenarios to be explored when thinking deeply about new relationships, roles and experiences that will emerge by having an intelligent agent or system on the side of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started this project by digging in the kitchen world. We worked with Mill and followed all the steps taken in a professional kitchen before and after the actual cooking and serving of a meal: from deciding the menu, sketching the plates, dividing the task, and eventually spending a full day in a real kitchen cooking a 4-course menu for 60 people.&lt;/p&gt;
