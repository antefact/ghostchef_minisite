While the first image we have in our head when we talk about technology and artificial intelligence is probably a restaurant full of  robot arms chopping food or some sort of recipe generators or a bot, we believe that there are a lot more interesting scenarios to be explored when thinking deeply about new relationships, roles and experiences that will emerge by having an intelligent agent or system on the side of people.

We started this project by digging in the kitchen world. We worked with Mill and followed all the steps taken in a professional kitchen before and after the actual cooking and serving of a meal: from deciding the menu, sketching the plates, dividing the task, and eventually spending a full day in a real kitchen cooking a 4-course menu for 60 people.
